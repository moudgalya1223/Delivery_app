Parcel Route App
Description
Parcel Route App is a unique delivery platform designed for users who want to send parcels within a limited geographical range. This app is available as a web application, with plans to extend it to the Play Store. The primary feature of this app is that it enables users to send parcels via people who are traveling the same route the parcel needs to follow, restricted to pickups and drops within a 5 km radius of the user’s location.

Key Features
Map-based Delivery: Leverages Google Maps to show available routes and drop-off points within a 5 km range of the user’s current geolocation.
Dynamic Pickup and Drop: Instead of relying on dedicated couriers, the app identifies people traveling the same route, allowing them to carry and drop parcels.
Efficient Routing: The app uses advanced route matching algorithms to ensure parcels are sent and received in the most efficient manner.
How It Works
Create an Account: Users can create an account and log in via the web app or mobile app (Play Store version coming soon).
Submit a Parcel Request: The user enters the destination and pickup details. The app will restrict delivery requests to within 5 km of the user’s location.
Route Matching: The app finds travelers who are heading in the same direction and connects them with the parcel sender.
Parcel Delivery: Once a traveler accepts the delivery, the parcel is picked up and delivered to the specified destination along the traveler's route.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Angular (Web)
Backend: Node.js
Authentication: Firebase for user sign-in and social login options.
Mapping Service: Google Maps API for route and location integration.
